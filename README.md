# MatchDJ
Under development. Bugs may occur. Executables are only available on Windows and Ubuntu. 

Executables can be created on Mac ruuning these commands in a terminal located in parent directory of this repo: 
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller -n MatchDJ --onefile src/main.py --windowed
```

## How to use it
Download the [executable folder](https://github.com/Hlanden/MatchDJ/tree/master/Executables) for your OS. Unzip it an run it in from the unzipped folder. 

When you open the application, you need to log into your spotify and accept that the application can control your spotify. When you have logged in, this descision will be remembered the next time you use it. 

### Creating loading playlists: 
You need to create playlists to use the application. Each time you press "Goal" a song from the playlist will be played for 10 seconds, starting the song at a given offset (so it starts at thedrop for instance). This is done in the following procedure:

1. Play a song on spotify 
2. Find the drop of the song
3. Pause the song 
4. Press the "Add" button

This will add the song to the current playlist. You will then see that the current playlist is unsaved. Press "Save As" to save the playlist.

### Loading playlist
YOu can load premade playlists pressing the "Browse..." button. 

### Using the app
* Goal: Whis will play a song for 10 seconds ramping the sound up in the start and down in the end
* 2 min: This will play "Du k√§re lille snickerbo" for 15 seconds
* Straffe: This will play "Darth Vaders theme" for 15 seconds

If you have already pressed one of these buttons, you will have to wait until the commad is done before you can press a new button. 

Enjoy :)
